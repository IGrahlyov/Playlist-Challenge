# Playlist-Challenge
As I'm going through Tim Buchalka's Java Masterclass course I want to share a few of the more interesting challenges I've completed on the way. I've included projects that I was able to make more personalized and with additional goals set by myself. This is a program with the functionality of creating a collection of albums and songs, and creating a playlist from them.
